Symphony No. 1 (Szymanowski)

Polish composer Karol Szymanowski worked on his Symphony No. 1 in F minor Op. 15 between 1906 and 1907. Szymanowski struggled with the composition. He wrote in a letter from 1906 that it was going to "turn out to be some sort of contrapuntal-harmonic-orchestral monster" and going so far as to say "I don't like it". He only completed the first movement and the finale and these two movements had a single performance at the Warsaw Philharmonia, conducted by Grzegorz Fitelberg on 26 March 1909, before Szymanowski withdrew the score. The symphony is scored for 3 flutes, 3 oboes, 4 clarinets, 3 bassoons, 6 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, percussion (4 players), 2 harps and strings. The two movements are: 1. Allegro moderato 2. Allegretto con moto grazioso The playing time is approximately 20 minutes. ==Recordings== * Chandos - BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Edward Gardner * LSO Live - London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Valery Gergiev * Naxos - Polish State Philharmonic Orchestra (Katowice), conducted by Karol Stryja * Naxos - Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Antoni Wit == References == Category:Symphonies by Karol Szymanowski Category:1907 compositions Category:20th-century symphonies Category:Compositions in F minor
