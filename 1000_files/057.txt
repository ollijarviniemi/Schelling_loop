Sigurd Kalheim

Sigurd Kalheim (born 4 April 1927 in Hjelmeland, died 18 July 2007) was a Norwegian politician for the Liberal Party and the Liberal People's Party. Kalheim, who belonged to Telemark, was never elected directly to the Parliament of Norway but served as a deputy representative in the period 1969-1973\. During this term he was brought in as a replacement representative for Hallvard Eika, who was appointed to the Cabinet at that time. In December 1972, Jakobsen joined the Liberal People's Party which split from the Liberal Party over disagreements of Norway's proposed entry to the European Economic Community. Kalheim sat through that term, but like most of the Liberal People's Party politicians he failed to be elected in the 1973 general election. On the local level Kalheim was a member of the executive committee of Skien city council during the terms 1967-1971, 1971-1975 and 1975â€“1979. Outside politics he graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1951.
