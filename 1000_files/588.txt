A Taste of Honey (album)

A Taste of Honey is the debut album by the American rhythm and blues group A Taste of Honey. It was produced by Fonce Mizell & Larry Mizell for Sky High Productions and included the number one pop, soul and disco classic "Boogie Oogie Oogie". == Critical reception == Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: "Those who cite 'Boogie Oogie Oogie' as definitive disco dumbness should reread the lyrics of 'Tutti Frutti' and think about the great tradition of the left-field girl- group novelty—'Mr. Lee,' 'Iko Iko,' 'Shame, Shame, Shame.' But though a couple of other songs here, notably 'Distant,' indicate that their pan may flash again, late converts are advised to seek out the single and wish they could buy the disco disc." ==Track listing== #"Boogie Oogie Oogie" (Janice Johnson, Perry Kibble) 5:37 #"This Love of Ours" (Hazel Payne, Janice Johnson) 3:20 #"Distant" (Janice Johnson, Perry Kibble) 4:38 #"World Spin" (Perry Kibble, Thurman Aldridge) 3:42 #"Disco Dancin'" (Allan Barnes, John Malone) 3:29 #"You" (Donald R.
