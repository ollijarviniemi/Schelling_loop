Gulustan Mahmood

Gulustan Mahmood Ieso (born 1 August 1991), also known as Kolestan Mahmoud, is an Iraqi track and field athlete who competes in sprinting events. She holds a number of Iraqi records and helped win her country's first ever women's medals at the Asian Athletics Championships in 2011. She lost these medals as her doping sample at that competition came back positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine, receiving a one-year ban for the infraction. Following in the footsteps of Dana Hussein Abdul-Razzaq and Alaa Jassim, her first major appearances came in 2009 when she won the 400 metres and 4×400 metres relay gold medals at the Arab Athletics Championships, as well finishing as runner- up in the 200 metres. Ieso represented her country in the two individual sprints at the 2009 Asian Athletics Championships. At the 2009 Asian Indoor Games she set two Iraqi records, running 7.53 seconds for the 60 metres (finishing sixth) and an indoor record of 53.75 seconds for the 400 m – a time which brought her the silver medal in the event, behind Chen Jingwen. She then helped the Iraqi women's 400 m relay team to a third national record of 3:59.01 minutes. Kolestan Mahmoud. Tilastopaja. Retrieved on 2011-08-15.Krishnan, Ram. Murali (2009-11-01).
