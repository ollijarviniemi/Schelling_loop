This song is a cover of the Chilean thrash metal band Pentagram. Not to be confused with the American doom metal band Pentagram. "Nazi Punks Fuck Off" ends at 1:13. After 4 minutes and 57 seconds of silence (1:13 - 6:10), at 6:10 a soundbite comes fading in of a fan presenting himself and then translating his own speech into Welsh. This kind of ghost track, with some slight changes, pops out in other two Napalm Death albums so far, Order of the Leech and Enemy of the Music Business. ==Personnel== ===Napalm Death=== * Mark "Barney" Greenway – vocals * Shane Embury – bass * Mitch Harris – guitar * Jesse Pintado – guitar * Danny Herrera – drums ===Technical personnel=== * Simon Efemey – production, engineering * Russ Russell – production, engineering * Mid – photo images ==References== Category:1999 EPs Category:Covers EPs Category:Napalm Death EPs
