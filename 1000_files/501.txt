Tigre Uno

Tigre Uno (born April 4, 1981) is a Mexican professional wrestler. He is best known for his time with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he is a one-time X Division Champion. Outside of the United States he is best known for his work in Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), where he is a former two-time holder of the AAA Cruiserweight and AAA World Tag Team Championships and the 2011 Rey de Reyes tournament winner as Extreme Tiger. ==Professional wrestling career== ===Early career=== After training under Rey Misterio, Tiger debuted in late 1998 at the age of just 17. Over the years he has wrestled as Tyger Mask, an imitation of the Japanese Tiger Mask character before settling on the name "Extreme Tiger" (sometimes spelled Xtreme Tiger). He first gained notoriety as part of the World Wrestling Association (WWA) in Tijuana, Baja California, which became his "home territory". He also began working for Desastre Total Ultraviolento (DTU) and Nueva Generation Xtrema (NGX), adopting a more hardcore style of wrestling that involved the use of weapons, tables, chair and ladders in the matches. ===Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (2006–2012)=== Through DTU's connection to Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) Extreme Tiger began working for the promotion in 2006, working as a rudo (bad guy) who was used in random lower to mid-card matches. After wrestling as a mid-card wrestler throughout the year, he became a técnico (good guy) in 2007. shortly after turning técnico, Tiger won the annual Alas de Oro tournament. Later in the year, he reverted to a rudo as he began teaming with Halloween and Juventud Guerrera as La Familia de Tijuana. On April 27, 2008 Extreme Tiger and Halloween defeated The Mexican Powers (Crazy Boy and Joe Líder) to win the AAA World Tag Team Championship, his first title in AAA. The team held the title for nearly five months, although Halloween did not wrestled for part of that time, before losing the championship to La Hermandad 187 (Joe Líder and Nicho el Millonario) on September 14. After the title loss, Halloween left AAA, ending La Familia de Tijuana. Tiger then participated in the 2008 Alas de Oro, but was unable to win the tournament for the second year in a row as he was eliminated as the second to last competitor, leaving only Jack Evans and 2008 winner Aero Star. Extreme Tiger greeting his fans In 2009 Extreme Tiger participated in a tournament to crown the first ever AAA Cruiserweight Champion. Tiger defeated Crazy Boy in the first round of the tournament and Jack Evans in the semi-finals. The finals was a triple threat match that also included Alan Stone and Alex Koslov, which Koslov won to become the first Cruiserweright champion. A few weeks later, at Triplemania XVII, Extreme Tiger won the Cruiserweight Title from Koslov in a multi-competitor match that also included Alan Stone and Crazy Boy. On August 21, 2009 at the 2009 Verano de Escandalo, he lost the title in an elimination match when he was the last man eliminated by Koslov following a low blow. Extreme Tiger lost the title in his first title defense. Following the Verano de Escandalo show then-champion Alex Koslov was fired (in storyline terms) from AAA and the title was vacated. Extreme Tiger was one of five participants selected to wrestle for the vacant title at Heroes Inmortales III. Tiger won his second Cruiserweight Title by winning 5-man ladder match against Sugi San, Jack Evans, Rocky Romero and Teddy Hart.

On June 6, 2010, at Triplemania XVIII Tiger lost the Cruiserweight Championship to Jack Evans in a four-way elimination match, which also included Nosawa and the man who eliminated him from the match, Christopher Daniels.
