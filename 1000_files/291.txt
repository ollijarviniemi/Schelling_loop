Jean-Pierre Cortot

Le Triomphe de 1810, sculpted group on the Arc de Triomphe, Paris Jean-Pierre Cortot (20 August 1787 – 12 August 1843) was a French neoclassical sculptor. == Life == Cortot was born and died in Paris. He was educated at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris, and won the Prix de Rome in 1809, residing in the Villa Medici in Rome from 1810 to 1813. Cortot worked in an austere, correct, academic neo-classical style, heir to both classic French models from the late 18th century and the Greco-Roman tradition. His art took on a more romantic expression toward the end of his life. Appointed a professor at the École, succeeding Charles Dupaty, he was made a member of the Académie des beaux-arts in 1825, again replacing Dupaty. He was made an Officer of the Légion d'honneur in 1841. Among his students were Joseph-Marius Ramus, Jean-Jacques Feuchère, Pierre-Charles Simart, Jean-Auguste Barre, and the animalier Pierre Louis Rouillard. A street in Montmartre bears his name, and Cortot's grave can be found in Père Lachaise Cemetery. ==Early works and works completed in Rome== Source: WikiPhidias Winning the Prix de Rome entitled him to study at the Académie de France in Rome and whilst there he completed several works which were sent back to Paris.

The sculptor Pierre II Biard used a cast of a horse intended for a statue of Henri II on which he placed an effigy of Louis XIII which by all accounts was proportionately too big for the horse. The bronze was melted down during the French revolution for the production of canons. In 1825 a new statue was erected, this a white marble work which Cortot had based on a model by Charles Dupaty executed in 1816. |- |Corneille |Hôtel de ville, Rouen |align="center"|1822 |Cortot's white marble statue stands in the Hôtel de Ville's "Hall d'honneur" .

This group features Napoleon, crowned by the goddess of Victory. The Arc de triomphe was intended to honour the victory of Napoleon's army at Austerlitz and in fact became a monument celebrating all his achievements. The architects Chalgrin, Joust and Blouet were charged with the monument's design and Cortot, François Rude, Antoine Etex and Pradier were chosen to carry out the sculptural work involved. The Arc de Triomphe has three arches and the main hauts-relief are positioned on its four pillars. François Rude's "le Départ des Volontaires" and Cortot's "Le Triomphe de Napoléon" face the Champs Elysées, and Etex's "La République" and "La Paix" face the Avenue de la Grande Armée. Above these hauts-reliefs are six bas-reliefs recalling the battle of Austerlitz, the funeral of Marceau, the taking of Alexandria, the battle of Jemmapes, the passage of the pont d'Arcole and the battle of Aboukir. |- |L'Immortalité |The Louvre.Département des Sculptures |align="center"|1835 |The work was intended to replace the cross on the dome of the Panthéon.
