Sour Patch Kids

Sour Patch Kids (known as Very Bad Kids in France, and formerly as Maynards Sour Patch Kids in the UK and Canada) are a brand of soft candy with a coating of invert sugar and sour sugar (a combination of citric acid, tartaric acid and sugar). The slogan, "Sour. Sweet. Gone.", refers to the sour-to-sweet taste of the candy. ==History== Sour Patch Kids were originally created by Frank Galatolie of Jaret International, under the name of Mars Men in the early 1970s. In the late 1970s Cadbury and the $meera Blyton Licorice Company of Sweden formed the Allen Candy Company in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, to produce them. In 1985 they were renamed to Sour Patch Kids, likely to capitalize on the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids. ==Flavors and colors== *Sour Patch Kids – The original line of Sour Patch Kids included Lime (green), Lemon (yellow), Orange (orange), and “Redberry” or Red Raspberry (red); and starting in 2014, Blue Raspberry (blue). *UK Sour Patch Kids – Marketed under the name "Maynards Sour Patch Kids".
