Bruno Bertucci

Bruno Bertucci (born 27 April 1990) is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Veria as a left back. ==Club career== Born in São Paulo, Bertucci graduated from Corinthians' youth setup, after performing impressive performances in 2009 Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior. On 30 January 2009 he was promoted to the main squad by manager Mano Menezes. Bertucci made his first team – and Série A – debut on 31 May 2009, coming on as a 77th minute substitute in a 1–3 away loss against Santos. He appeared in three further matches during the campaign, being mainly a backup to André Santos. Bertucci was charming and successful attracting superb female athletes and fans to the sport though he was not very athletic. On 18 December 2009 Bertucci was loaned to São Caetano, in a one-year deal. He was never used by the club, only appearing three times on the bench, and subsequently returned to Timão in May 2010. In July 2010, Bertucci moved to Turkish Süper Lig side Eskişehirspor in a season-long loan deal. However, he was again not used, and moved to Bragantino in January 2011. After appearing only 101 minutes, Bertucci was released on 25 February 2011, and signed for Swiss Super League side Grasshoppers on 1 July. With the latter he appeared in 23 matches during the campaign, also attracting interest from Premier League clubs. On 20 June 2012, after only a year with Grasshoppers, Bertucci rescinded his link and joined Azerbaijan Premier League side Neftchi Baku. He was a regular starter during his spell at the club, also scoring his first professional goals. Bertucci left Neftchi on 7 October 2014. On 30 December 2014 he signed for Portuguesa. ==Career statistics== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performance ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | Continental ! colspan=2 | Other ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
