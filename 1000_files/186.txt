Frank Wright (footballer)

Frank Wright (born 1898) was an English footballer who made one Football League appearance at outside-right for Southampton in 1920. ==Football career== Wright was born in Birmingham and played for Hamstead Colliery where he was spotted by a scout from Southampton. He joined the "Saints" in October 1920 and after scoring regularly for the reserves, he made his first-team debut on 11 December 1920, when he replaced Joe Barratt in a Third Division match at Grimsby Town. The team was soundly beaten 3â€“0, and Wright returned to the reserves together with Charlie Brown and Alec Campbell. His brief taste of first-team football appeared to have dented his confidence, for Wright only managed one further goal in 26 subsequent reserve-team matches before he was released in May 1921. ==References== Category:1898 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:English footballers Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Association football forwards Category:English Football League players
