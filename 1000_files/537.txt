Longhai City

Longhai is a county-level city within the prefecture-level city of Zhangzhou, in the south of Fujian province, People's Republic of China. Longhai comprises territory on both banks of the lower Jiulong River, although most of its area is on the right (southern) bank. The left bank yields to Xiamen before reaching the sea, the right bank becomes the south shore of Xiamen Bay and is home to the Zhangzhou Port tariff-free industrial export zone, in Longhai's Gangwei Town. Longhai has a population of 801,100. ==History== left Following the revocation of the sea ban (haijin) in the late Ming, Yuegang (within present-day Haicheng in Longhai) became a key port for China's silver trade with Manila in the Spanish Philippines. It was one of Fujian's four main commercial ports.漳州月港 Present-day Longhai is the only county-level city within the prefecture-level city of Zhangzhou.

It is located near Hongtang Village () in Longhai's Yancuo Town, but, as its name indicates, it is actually closer to Zhangzhou's main urban area than to Longhai's. It is the junction of two high-speed rail lines: the Longyan-Xiamen Railway (opened in June 2012) and the Xiamen-Shenzhen Railway (to open by 2013), which share their tracks from Zhangzhou to Xiamen. Railway development plans also include the construction of a 45-km-long branch line from Zhangzhou Railway Station eastward, across most of Longhai City to terminate at the China Merchants Group industrial area () in Gangwei Town on the southwestern shore of Xiamen Harbor, opposite Xiamen Island (). The branch will be known as Gangwei Railway (), and will support trains running at speeds up to 120 km/h. Its opening is planned for 2013.厦深港尾铁路明年通车 漳州高铁增至280多公里 (Xiashen and Gangwei rail lines to open next year; Zhangzhou's high-speed railway lines trackage to exceed 280 km), Haixia Daobao (海峡导报), 2012-08-02, ==Climate== ==References== == External links == * Category:Cities in Fujian Category:County-level divisions of Fujian
