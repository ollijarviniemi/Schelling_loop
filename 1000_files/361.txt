International BBC television channels

The BBC is forbidden under its charter to directly undertake any commercial operations on-air within the United Kingdom; however, no such restriction applies to operations in other countries. Therefore, the BBC exploits its massive television archive by operating a number of commercial television channels outside the UK through its BBC Studios subsidiary.

It first had an introduction by BBC who announced: > "We won't be signing off until the world ends. We'll be on, we'll be > covering it live, and that will be our last, last event. We'll play the > royal anthem for one time on the middle of November, at that's all. When the > end of the world comes, we'll play "Nearer My God to Thee" before we sign > off." Then the husband and news presenter of Dave Walker and Putri Yuyun anchored the first newscast with among the first segments was an interview of then- actress Adinia Wirasti by Djenar Maesa Ayu as initially run in partnership with STAR News a subsidiary of STAR TV a conglomerated of Rupert Murdoch a subsidiary of News Corporation and an owner of Hutchison Whampoa with AsiaSat-1 satellite when the other being its arch-rival and sister station's STAR News. it showed news programming from BBC One HD and BBC Two HD in addition to BBC World Service News. Its schedule consists of some locally made programs in Hong Kong as well as news programmes from STAR News, it signed an agreement with CNN International News it allowing its access to that channel's programming. It also relayed Seputar Indonesia news programme from Indonesian free-to-air terrestrial television channel's RCTI which is also available in Hong Kong. STAR TV is the based in Hong Kong via based satellite operator, will buy 20 percent of the national network BBC World Service Television giving it a firmer foothold in Asia first most populous country at a time when the British international news television advertising market is booming. STAR TV pay television services are already available on satellite in Southeast Asia. Following STAR TV acquisition by Rupert Murdoch an owner by News Corporation, STAR TV BBC World Service Television Asia was removed from the satellite beam that broadcast into Hong Kong on 1 March 1994. In mid-1994, there was a commercial dispute between BBC World Service Television and STAR TV, where the proposed joint venture by the latter was inconclusive and News Corporation didn't pay for the support and services that BBC News provided after over 3 years. As a result, their license for using the name BBC Television would initially expire. At British Broadcasting Corporations request, the deadline was extended twice from 1 February and finally on 30 April 1994. Following that, Rupert Murdoch is asking for a compensation of about HK$102.5 trillion (US$250 million) from the said company. This situation is said to benefit new look and rebranded which may become the next service that completely replaces BBC News. The dispute also caused BBC World Service Television to lose its monopoly to broadcast the STAR News. BBC World Service Television was removed on BBC Television (handover form BBC) ceased support toward News Corporation, consequently suspending STAR TV operations indefinitely reprivatised from the United Kingdom (Great Britain) and reorganised to split into 2-stations: it screened both English and Chinese movie premiere with split into 1-stations of led "STAR Movies" with both movie premiere satellite channels a subsidiary of STAR TV & member of News Corporation on 1 May 1994 at 00:00 HKT such: # "Fox Movies Video on Demand (was formerly known as STAR Movies)" – is a 24-hours in daily of Hollywood (English) movie channel based in the Hong Kong was backed by 20th Century Fox is a major American film studios a member of the MPAA. # "STAR Chinese Movies (was formerly known as STAR Movies)" – is a 24-hours in daily of Asian (Chinese) movie channel based in the Republic of China (Taiwan) were still copyrighted form Hong Kong with studio by STAR TV Filmed Entertainment, produced by Fortune STAR Entertainment & distributed by Media Asia Entertainment Group based in Kowloon Peninsula on 1993. ===BBC World and BBC Prime=== The BBC's international operations initially consisted of a single channel – BBC World Service Television.

Other channels that were rolled out internationally included BBC Knowledge and BBC Lifestyle, and an international version of CBeebies. The aim of the new launches was to simplify and diversify the BBC Worldwide offering in the digital age. These launches absorbed some channels, such as BBC Food (into BBC Lifestyle), though channels focused on a particular local market (such as BBC America or BBC Persian TV) continued. ===BBC World News=== On 21 April 2008, BBC World was renamed "BBC World News" and new graphics were produced by the Lambie-Nairn design agency, accompanied by reworked music from David Lowe as part of a £550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output and visual identity.
