It was the 63rd running of the Champion Hurdle. The winner was Sheikh Mohammed's Royal Gait, a nine-year-old bay gelding trained in Suffolk by James Fanshawe and ridden by Graham McCourt. Royal Gait's victory was a first in the race for jockey and trainer, and a second for the owner who had won the 1990 running with Kribensis. Royal Gait had been an outstanding stayer on the flat winning the Group One Prix du Cadran and Prix Royal Oak in 1987 and being controversially disqualified after finishing first in the 1988 Ascot Gold Cup. On what was only his fourth race over hurdles he started at odds of 6/1 and won the Champion Hurdle by half a length and a short head from Oh So Risky and Ruling. Two previous winners of the race, Morley Street and Kribensis took part: Morley Street was made the 2/1 favourite and finished sixth whilst Kribensis finished last. The second favourite Granville Again fell at the penultimate hurdle. Fourteen of the sixteen runners completed the course. ==Race details== * Sponsor: Smurfit * Purse: £133,661; First prize: £80,065 * Going: Good * Distance: 2 miles * Number of runners: 16 * Winner's time: 3m 57.40 ==Full result== {| class = "sortable" | border="1" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse;" |- style="background:#7d7; text-align:center;" ! style="width:35px;"| Pos. ! style="width:45px;"| Marg. ! style="width:160px;"| Horse (bred) ! style="width:30px;"| Age ! style="width:160px;"| Jockey ! style="width:210px;"| Trainer (Country) ! style="width:50px;"| Odds |- | 1 | | Royal Gait (GB) | 9 | Graham McCourt | James Fanshawe (GB) | 6/1 |- | 2 | ½ | Oh So Risky (GB) | 5 | Paul Holley | David Elsworth (GB) | 20/1 |- | 3 | shd | Ruling (USA) | 6 | Peter Niven | Fulke Johnson Houghton (GB) | 20/1 |- | 4 | 6 | Fidway (IRE) | 7 | Hywel Davies | Tim Thomson Jones (GB) | 7/1 |- | 5 | 1 | Bank View (GB) | 7 | M.
