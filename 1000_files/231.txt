Cloacibacterium

Cloacibacterium normanense is a bacterium originally found in wastewater in Norman, Oklahoma. This genus in the family Flavobacteriaceae was new to science when it was described in 2006. It is Gram-negative, non-motile, and facultatively anaerobic. Physically, it is a rod-shaped organism with yellow pigmentation. This organism was discovered using a non-selective medium, as opposed to the traditional selective media often used to isolate microorganisms. In this case, the method involved diluting raw sewage. ==References== * * Category:Flavobacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2006 Category:Bacteria genera
