Thomas and Walter Monteith House

Thomas and Walter Monteith House, also known as the Monteith House Museum was the first frame house built in Albany, Oregon, United States. It was built by Walter and Thomas Monteith in 1848â€“1850. All the house's original boards are hand-hewn due to lack of availability of steam-powered buzzsaws at that time. Originally the home served as a combination dwelling and store, but soon became the residence of Thomas and Christine (Dunbar) Monteith. Described architecturally as "Rural Vernacular / Pre-Classic Revival," the house was extensively remodeled in 1855 and 1880, moved 50 feet west in 1901, and in 1922 again remodeled, such that the structure little resembled the original construction. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Beginning in 1982 the house has been a museum highlighting the Monteiths' contributions to the area's community. "Living history" events are periodically given at the museum. ==References== ==External links== *Monteith House (official site) from Albany Visitors Association *Illustrating Four Treatments in Oregon article on restoration of the house from the National Park Service Category:Buildings and structures in Albany, Oregon Category:Museums in Linn County, Oregon Category:Historic house museums in Oregon Category:National Register of Historic Places in Linn County, Oregon Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Oregon Category:Houses completed in 1850 Category:1850 establishments in Oregon Territory Category:Houses in Linn County, Oregon
