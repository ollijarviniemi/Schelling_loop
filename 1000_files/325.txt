Songs (Fra Lippo Lippi album)

Songs is the third studio album by Norwegian new wave band Fra Lippo Lippi. Originally released in 1985 by the band's own label, Easter Productions, Songs received favorable reviews and sold around 5,000 copies without any means of promotion. Later that year, Virgin Records signed the band to a worldwide contract. The album was reissued and released internationally in 1986 with some songs re-recorded or remixed and the addition of the song "Everytime I See You". "Shouldn't Have to Be Like That", "Everytime I See You" and "Come Summer" were released as singles in Europe, while "Everytime I See You" and "The Distance Between Us" became popular hits in the Philippines. This version of the album also sold 20,000 copies in Norway.Fra Lippo Lippi History The sleeve photography by Reinhard Wolf shows the medieval alcazar of Molina de Aragon in Spain. Positive response from critics and sales performance of Songs prompted Virgin Records to have the band work on a follow-up album. Unfortunately, by the time Light and Shade was released in 1988, Virgin Records dropped the band. In 2005, the album was reissued by band founder Rune Kristoffersen's label Rune Arkiv. It features the original 1985 Easter Productions recordings (as the 1986 release is still property of Virgin Records) plus the live album Crash of Light, which was previously released only in the Philippines.Amazon.com - Fra Lippo Lippi's Songs CD ==Track listing== ===1985 Original Easter Productions release=== # "Come Summer"Fra Lippo Lippi Discography # "Shouldn't Have to Be Like That" # "Even Tall Trees Bend" # "Just Like Me" # "Crash of Light" # "The Distance Between Us" # "Regrets" # "Leaving" # "Coming Home" ===1986 Virgin Records release=== # "Come Summer" # "Shouldn't Have to Be Like That" # "Even Tall Trees Bend" # "Just Like Me" # "Leaving" # "Regrets" # "Everytime I See You" # "Crash of Light" # "The Distance Between Us" # "Coming Home" ===2005 Rune Arkiv reissue=== # "Come Summer" # "Shouldn't Have to Be Like That" # "Even Tall Trees Bend" # "Just Like Me" # "Leaving" # "Regrets" # "Crash of Light" # "The Distance Between Us" # "Coming Home" # "Crash Of Light" (Live) # "The Distance Between Us" (Live) # "Everytime I See You" (Live) # "Fade Away" (Live) # "Shouldn't Have to Be Like That" (Live) # "Even Tall Trees Bend" (Live) # "Say Something" (Live) # "Regrets" (Live) ==Personnel== *Rune Kristoffersen - Bass, keyboards *Per Øystein Sørensen - Vocals, keyboards with *Morten Sjøberg - Additional keyboards *Øyvind Kvalnes - Additional keyboards *Henrik Janson - Guitars (Virgin Records release) *Erik Häusler - Saxophone (Virgin Records release) *Åke Sundquist - Percussion (Virgin Records release) *Tore Elgarøy - Guitar, backing vocals (Rune Arkiv reissue - Live tracks) *Lasse Hafreager - Keyboards, backing vocals (Rune Arkiv reissue - Live tracks) *Berit Lohne - Piano, backing vocals (Rune Arkiv reissue - Live tracks) *Bjørn Juliusson - Drums & percussion (Rune Arkiv reissue - Live tracks) ==References== Category:Fra Lippo Lippi (band) albums Category:1985 albums
