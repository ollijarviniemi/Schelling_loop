However, on 1 March 2011, two days before the official voting was to take place, Zimbabwe withdrew, leaving Canada as the only bidder.

In July, all Nigeria teams became subject of a FIFA ban due to government interference with the national football association. The team faced exclusion from the tournament until the ban was lifted nine days later. ==Venues== On 2 June 2013, FIFA announced that Edmonton, Moncton, Montreal and Toronto would be the host cities for the tournament. The first three cities had been previously announced as host cities for the 2015 Women's World Cup, along with Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Ottawa. Toronto did not apply to host the 2015 tournament due to conflicts with the 2015 Pan American Games, but does not face any such conflicts in 2014. Meanwhile, Ottawa indicated in late 2012 that it would not be able to participate in hosting the U-20 tournament due to construction delays on the Lansdowne Park redevelopment. As was the case during the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, BMO Field in Toronto was known as the National Soccer Stadium during the tournament, due to FIFA policies regarding corporate sponsorship of stadiums. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;" |- ! width=200| Edmonton ! width=200| Moncton ! width=200| Montreal ! width=200| Toronto |- | Commonwealth Stadium | Moncton Stadium | Olympic Stadium | National Soccer Stadium (BMO Field) |- | Capacity: 56,302 | Capacity: 10,000 (expandable to 20,000) | Capacity: 65,255 | Capacity: 21,859 |- |200px |200px |200px |200px |} ==Sponsors== ===FIFA partners=== * Adidas * Coca-Cola * Hyundai/Kia Motors * Emirates * Sony * Visa ===National supporters=== * FIFA.com * Bell Canada * Live Your Goals ==Match officials== A total of 13 referees, 5 reserve referees, and 26 assistant referees were appointed by FIFA for the tournament. {| class="wikitable" |- !Confederation !Referees !Assistant referees |- |AFC | Qin Liang Sachiko Yamagishi Ri Hyang-ok (reserve) | Fang Yan Allyson Flynn Sarah May Yee Ho Liang Jianping |- |CAF | Therese Sango Therese Neguel (reserve) | Tempa Justine Fouti N'Da Trhas Gebreyohanis |- |CONCACAF | Quetzalli Alvarado Godinez Carol Anne Chenard Margaret Domka Michelle Pye (reserve) | Marie-Josée Charbonneau Mayte Ivonne Chavez Garcia Marlene Duffy Suzanne Morisset Shirley Susana Perello Lopez Veronica Perez |- |CONMEBOL | Jesica Salome Di Iorio Claudia Ines Umpierrez Rodriguez (reserve) | Mariana Betina Corbo Odone Maria Eugenia Rocco |- |OFC | Finau Vulivuli | Jacqueline Stephenson Sarah Walker |- |UEFA | Kirsi Heikkinen Kateryna Monzul Esther Staubli Bibiana Steinhaus Carina Vitulano Katalin Kulcsár (reserve) | Ella De Vries Anu Jokela Chrysoula Kourompylia Sian Massey Anna Nyström Tonja Paavola Yolando Pargo Rodriguez Lucie Ratajova Katrin Rafalski Marina Wozniak |} ==Squads== Each team named a squad of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline.
