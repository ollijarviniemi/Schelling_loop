Rhaebo haematiticus

Rhaebo haematiticus (formerly Bufo haematiticus) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is found in eastern Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, northwestern Venezuela (Serranía del Perijá), and northwestern Ecuador. Its altitudinal range is from sea level to asl. Its natural habitats are primary tropical moist forest and submontane humid forest. It is a nocturnal, leaf-litter species that during the breeding seasons is found along small streams and large rivers. It tolerates some habitat degradation but only occurs close to forest. Threats to it are habitat loss caused by agriculture, wood extraction, and cattle ranching, and locally oil pollution and dams. ==References== haematiticus Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of Honduras Category:Amphibians of Nicaragua Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1862
