Snodgrass

The family name Snodgrass is said to originate from lands in the parish of Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland, known as Snodgrasse, or Snodgers, at a bend in the River Garnock at 55°38' north, 4°42' west, which were rented out in plots. Both forms are recorded in Ayrshire and in Glasgow between the 13th and 16th centuries. The name means "smooth grassy place" in Northern Middle English.Snodgrass Family History from Ancestry.co.uk, accessed 14 August 2016. In 1528 a charter from the King lists the lands of "Snotgerss" as being one of the confirmed possessions of Hugh, third Earl of Eglinton;Metcalfe, page 88. the next record seen of the name is in the late 17th century. ==Snodgrass in America== The first records of the Snodgrass family in the new world are in the early 18th century in Virginia. The Virginia town of Hedgesville (now West Virginia) was founded by William Snodgrass, who arrived in the American colonies in 1700. William Snodgrass is buried in the cemetery of Tuscarora Presbyterian Church in Berkeley County, West Virginia. Closer examination reveals a wave of immigrants from Scotland during the Highland Clearances, Highland Potato Famine (1846–1857), and Lowland Clearances; increasing family sizes probably prompted many Snodgrasses to leave when the land could no longer support all of them. From Pennsylvania and other ports-of-entry, they have spread across the North American continent and today there are in excess of 6,000 Snodgrass families in the United States and Canada. ==Snodgrass Clan== In April 1979, a Certificate of Incorporation was granted to the Snodgrass Clan, Inc. by the state of Indiana. This was brought about by Scott F. Hosier, Jr. and Laurence E. Snodgrass. Through Hosier's efforts a "grant of arms" was granted to the Clan on March 15, 1984 by the Chief Herald of Ireland; however, the petition to be granted a "grant of arms" by Scotland was never finalized. In 1979, Hosier ordered and received the first order of the official Snodgrass tartan. The weave code for the Snodgrass tartan is `K6 R2 Y2 B22 G26 B10 R2 Y2`, which was sourced to Dgn. T. S. Davidson. ==People Named Snodgrass== Snodgrass, as a surname, may refer to these notable people: * Adrian Snodgrass, Australian architect and authority on Buddhist art * Anthony Snodgrass, (1934–), archaeologist * Bob Snodgrass, glass artist * Donald Ray Snodgrass (1935–), author * Fred Snodgrass (1887–1974), American baseball player * Guy Snodgrass, (1976–), national security expert * Harry Snodgrass (1963–), Sound Designer for Film and Television * John James Snodgrass * John Michael Owen Snodgrass, (1928–2008), ambassador * Jon Snodgrass, (1941–), Panamanian author * Kate Snodgrass, American theater director and playwright * Klyne Snodgrass, professor, theologian, author, alumnus of North Park Theological Seminary * Louise Virginia Snodgrass, (1942–), American legislator * Lynn Snodgrass, Oregon Speaker of the House * Mark A.
