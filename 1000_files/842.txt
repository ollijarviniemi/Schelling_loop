Golden Kite Award

The Golden Kite Awards are given annually by the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, an international children's writing organization, to recognize excellence in children’s literature. The award is a golden medallion showing a child flying a kite. Instituted in 1973, the Golden Kite Awards are the only children’s literary award judged by a jury of peers. Eligible books must be written or illustrated by SCBWI members, and submitted either by publishers or individuals. With the split of the Fiction award into a Middle Grade and a Young Adult award in 2016 and the split of Nonfiction into "for Younger Readers" and "for Older Readers" in 2018, the award currently includes six categories (the other two are Picture Book Text and Picture Book Illustration). Winners are chosen by a panel of judges consisting of children’s book writers and illustrators. In addition to the Golden Kite Award winners, honor book recipients are named by the judges. Since 2006, the best author and illustrator in each category wins a $2,500 grant cash prize. Since 2003, the Sid Fleischman Award for excellence in humorous writing is given in conjunction with the Golden Kite Awards. ==Recipients== The awards are given the year following publication. For example, the 2000 awards are for books published in 1999. === 2020 === *Young Reader and Middle Grade Fiction: The Bridge Home, Padma Venkatraman *Young Adult Fiction: Lovely War, Julie Berry *Nonfiction Text for Younger Readers: Mario and the Hole in the Sky: How a Chemist Saved Our Planet, Elizabeth Rusch *Nonfiction Text for Older Readers: Torpedoed: The True Story of the World War II Sinking of "The Children’s Ship", Deborah Heiligman *Picture Book Illustration: Clever Little Witch, Hyewon Yum (written by Muon Thị Van) *Picture Book Text: A Green Place to Be: The Creation of Central Park, Ashley Benham Yazdani === 2019 === *Middle Grade Fiction: Lifeboat 12, Susan Hood *Non-Fiction for Younger Readers: Otis and Will Discover the Deep, Barb Rosenstock *Non-Fiction for Older Readers: Boots on the Ground: America's War in Vietnam, Elizabeth Partridge *Picture Book Text: The Remember Balloons, Jessie Oliveros (illustrated by Dana Wulfekotte) *Picture Book Illustration: Made by Hand: A Crafts Sampler, Becca Stadtlander (written by Carole Lexa Schaefer) *Young Adult Fiction: Mapping the Bones, Jane Yolen === 2018 === *Middle Grade Fiction: See You in the Cosmos, Jack Cheng *Non-Fiction for Older Readers: Vincent and Theo, Deborah Heiligman *Non-Fiction for Younger Readers: Schomburg: The Man Who Built a Library, Carole Boston Weatherford *Picture Book Text: There Might Be Lobsters, Carolyn Crimi (illustrated by Laurel Molk) *Picture Book Illustration: Goodbye Autumn, Hello Winter, written and illustrated by Kenard Pak *Young Adult Fiction: What Girls Are Made Of, Elana K.
