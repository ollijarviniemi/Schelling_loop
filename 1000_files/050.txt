Room 101 (radio series)

Room 101 is a radio comedy series that ran from 1992 to 1994 on BBC Radio 5, before transferring to BBC television. Hosted by Nick Hancock, it was an alternative to the more established and formal Desert Island Discs. Celebrities were invited to discuss their "least favourite people, places and pop songs" in order to have them consigned to Room 101. ==Episode guide== ===Series One 1992 (six programmes)=== *Paul Merton (9 January 1992) *Jenny Eclair (16 January 1992) *Danny Baker (23 January 1992) *Arthur Smith (30 January 1992) *Steve Punt (6 February 1992) *Annie Nightingale (13 February 1992) ===Series Two 1992 (eight programmes)=== *Ian Hislop (14 August 1992) *Jo Brand (21 August 1992) *Tony Slattery (28 August 1992) *John Walters (4 September 1992) *Helen Lederer (11 September 1992) *David Baddiel (18 September 1992) *Stephen Frost (25 September 1992) *Donna McPhail (2 October 1992) ===Christmas Special 1992=== *Nick Hancock (22 December 1992) - Guest host Danny Baker ===Series Three 1993 (eight programmes)=== *Frank Skinner (27 August 1993) *Trevor and Simon (3 September 1993) *Caroline Quentin (10 September 1993) *Tony Hawks (17 September 1993) *Rory McGrath (8 October 1993) *Kevin Day (15 October 1993) *Maria McErlane (22 October 1993) *Mark Lamarr (29 October 1993) ===Series Four 1994 (four programmes)=== *Nick Revell (4 March 1994) *Simon Delaney (11 March 1994) *Chris England (18 March 1994) *Andy Hamilton (25 March 1994) ==Title== The title refers to the room in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four which, for each person, represents the worst fear they can imagine.
