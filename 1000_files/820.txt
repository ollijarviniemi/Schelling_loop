Central chromatolysis

Micrograph of the anterior horn of the spinal cord showing motor neurons with central chromatolysis. Neurofilament immunostain. Central chromatolysis is a histopathologic change seen in the cell body of a neuron, where the chromatin and cell nucleus are pushed to the cell periphery, in response to axonal injury.Neuropathology - Basic Reactions.

This response is associated with increased protein synthesis to accommodate for axonal sprouting. In addition to traumatic injuries, central chromatolysis may be caused by vitamin deficiency (pellagra). ==See also== *Motor neuron ==References== ==External links== *Neurocytology and Basic Reactions (neuropathologyweb.org) Category:Pathology
