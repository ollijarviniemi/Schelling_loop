Also arriving on the island is hotel owner, Livio, who has left his "girlfriend", Madame Benoit (Miranda), at the hotel to take care of the police detective (Robert Gardett), who has been asking questions about the robbers. But what Dolph, Lylle, and Darlene, don't know is; everyone else there on the island knows they're the robbers of the one-million dollars, and that they want the money. After a while on the island, people are starting to be killed, with the killer being unknown. Lylle, suspects the killer to be the holder of the one-million dollars or a person looking for it.

However, in the film's opening credits, Mansfield is billed last; as: "and Jayne Mansfield as Darlene"; she was also billed this way in most of the film's movie trailers. Even though Mansfield was capitalized as the movie's star, she was more of a supporting character. ==Background== Jayne Mansfield called the film: "The best role of my career." American audiences wanted to know were this role was, for Einer frisst den anderen was not released to American theaters until two years after its official German release, in 1964. When released in the U.S.. it was released as Dog Eat Dog!, and flopped as it did everywhere else. Today the feature carries on a cult gathering, as a forever "gold-digging" classic. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1964 films Category:Italian films Category:West German films Category:Italian crime films Category:German crime films Category:German black-and-white films Category:Italian black-and-white films Category:Films set on islands Category:Films set in the Mediterranean Sea Category:Films shot in Croatia Category:Films shot in Yugoslavia Category:1964 crime films
