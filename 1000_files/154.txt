Oikos (journal)

Oikos is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering research in the field of ecology. It is published by Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the Nordic Foundation Oikos. Since 2011, the editor-in-chief has been Dries Bonte of Ghent University. ==History== The journal was established in 1949 as Oikos: Acta Oecologica Scandinavica, together with the Nordic Foundation Oikos, to provide a vehicle for publishing in the growing field of ecology. The journal content would have no preference with regard to taxonomic group. In the 1970s the scope was narrowed to studies with relevance to the progress of theory in ecology. From 1949 to 1977, the journal appeared in one volume of three issues per year. From 1977 to 1987, two volumes per year were produced, and three volumes from 1987. In addition, from 1949–1975, a number of supplements were published at irregular intervals. Since 2007, the Oikos subject editors make nominations for the annual Per Brinck Oikos Award given to a world-leading ecologist. === Editors-in-chief === The following persons have been editors- in-chief: * 2011–present Dries Bonte, Ghent University * 2010–2011 Tim Benton, Leeds * 2004–2010 Per Lundberg, Lund * 1989–2004 Nils Malmer, Lund * 1965–1989 Per Brinck, Lund * 1949–1965 Christian Overgaard Nielsen, Copenhagen == External links == * * Nordic Foundation Oikos Category:Ecology journals Category:Publications established in 1949 Category:Monthly journals Category:Wiley-Blackwell academic journals Category:English-language journals
