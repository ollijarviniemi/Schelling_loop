As a league, the OVPL will operate within Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio to help local communities grow the beautiful game through competitive matches and local soccer culture. The amateur men’s division allows for players as young as sixteen (16) years old to compete in a structure that provides an opportunity for competition in the country’s longest-running tournament in the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup.
