WSYD

WSYD (1300 AM) is a radio station broadcasting an oldies format. Licensed to Mount Airy, North Carolina, United States, the station serves Surry County, North Carolina. The station is currently owned by Granite City Broadcasting and features programming from Salem Communications. ==History== WSYD started out playing rock and roll in the mid 1950s. Prior to the most recent change, the station played a mix of contemporary and classic country. The switch to oldies took place on April 6, 2011, after news director Mark Brown asked listeners what music they would like to hear. A poll was conducted, and the listeners voted overwhelmingly for the switch to a "pop oldies" format, dubbed "Granite City Gold." ==References== ==External links== *1300 Oldies Online * SYD
