He started learning karate at Kushukaikan during his high school life. Although he was only 16 years old, he won the All Japan Shin Karate championships at lightweight.第12回 全日本新空手道選手権大会 (Japanese) After winning the championship, he moved to Tokyo and joined Booch Beat, a kickboxing team, to be a kickboxer. On September 7, 2001, he debuted as a professional kickboxer for All Japan Kickboxing Federation(AJKF). At this time, he was only 17 years old. ===Professional kickboxing=== In 2004, Yamamoto challenged Yamauchi's welterweight championship on January 4, but he was defeated by the unanimous decision at 5R. On November 19, he challenged Yamauchi's title again, but he failed to win the title because the match resulted as a draw. In January 2006, he moved to Seishunjuku from Booch Beat. On February 6, 2005, he fought against Yoshihiro Sato. He was beaten completely as he was knocked down 6 times during the bout of 5R. Sato knocked down Yamamoto twice at 1R, twice at 2R, once at 3R, once at 4R. Yamamoto was going to be retired before fighting against Sato. For this reason, although he was offered only 10 days before, he accepted this bout as a replacement.Tokyo Sports, the 8th page, 2009-04-24 Although he intended to retire, this bout was evaluated by K-1; thereafter, he decided to continue his career. In 2007, he participated the tournament for the vacant welterweight championship of AJKF. He won the tournament on May 11, 2007, and 23rd champion of AJKF at welterweight.
