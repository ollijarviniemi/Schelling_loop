Taiping Heavenly Kingdom History Museum

The Taiping Kingdom History Museum ()is a museum dedicated to artifacts from the Taiping Rebellion (1851-1864). It is located on the grounds of the Zhan Yuan Garden (), a historical garden in Nanjing, China. ==History== The garden that surrounds the museum was once "Enthusiasm Garden" or "Zhan Garden" of the first ruler of the Ming Dynasty, Hongwu (1328-1398). In 1853, it became the residence of Yang Xiuqing, a military leader in the Taiping Rebellion. During the rebellion, Nanjing was captured by the rebels and used as its headquarters. They acquired large portions of land throughout China. At Beijing, the Qing Dynasty narrowly defeated the rebels in 1864, but it ended the war. ==Museum== In 1958, it became the site of the current museum. The museum has artifacts from the rebellion, including Taiping currency, weapons, uniforms, and documents about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom ideology, which was based upon an idiosyncratic version of Christianity. Hong Xiuquan believed he was Christ's younger brother, ordered by God to exterminate China's Manchu rulers, whom he decried as demons. ==Gallery== File:A Map Show the Defense of Beijing During the Period of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom 2011-12.JPG|A map showing the defense of Beijing during the Period of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom File:The Coin of Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace.JPG|The Coin of Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace ==See also== * List of museums in China ==References== ==External links== Category:Museums in Nanjing Category:History museums in China
