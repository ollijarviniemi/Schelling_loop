List of Christ myth theory proponents

This is a partial list of people who have been categorized as Christ myth theory proponents, the belief that "the historical Jesus did not exist. Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity".Ehrman, Bart D. (2012). Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth. HarperOne. pp. 12, 347, n. 1. "[Per Jesus mythicism] In a recent exhaustive elaboration of the position, one of the leading proponents of Jesus mythicism, Earl Doherty, defines the view as follows: it is “the theory that no historical Jesus worthy of the name existed, that Christianity began with a belief in a spiritual, mythical figure, that the Gospels are essentially allegory and fiction, and that no single identifiable person lay at the root of the Galilean preaching tradition.” [Jesus: Neither God nor Man: The Case for a mythical Jesus (Ottawa, ON: Age of Reason Publications, 2009), vii–viii.] In simpler terms, the historical Jesus did not exist. Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity." ==A== John Marco Allegro *John M. Allegro (1923–1988) – English archaeologist.Novenson, Matthew V. (2017).
