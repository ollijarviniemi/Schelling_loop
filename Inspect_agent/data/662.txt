Ode-Itsekiri

Ode-Itsekiri is a community in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria. It is also called Itsekiri-Olu and Big Warri. It is the ancestral home of the Itsekiri people and one of the first autonomous communities before the crowning of the Olu Ginuwa. It existed long before 1480, with exact data not known. The Olu's Palace in Ode-Itsekiri has always been used to crown the Olu of Warri Kingdom, while the Kings are buried at Ijala Community. The Delta State government started a road project around 2006 to link Warri and Ode-Itsekiri. This project is expected to link Ode-Itsekiri and other Itsekiri communities close to it. The popular song Megbele by Omawumi showed when she arrived at Ode-Itsekiri with boat and went to visit the Olu's Palace. ==References== Category:History of Nigeria Category:Nigerian traditional states
