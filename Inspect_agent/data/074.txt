20th Parliament of Ontario

The 20th Legislative Assembly of Ontario was in session from October 6, 1937, until June 30, 1943, just prior to the 1943 general election. The majority party was the Ontario Liberal Party led by Mitchell Hepburn. In 1938, the title "Member of Provincial Parliament", abbreviated as "MPP", was officially adopted by the members of the legislative assembly. Hepburn resigned as Premier in October 1942, remaining party leader, and Gordon Daniel Conant became Premier. In 1943, Harry Nixon became both party leader and Premier after a leadership convention was held for the provincial Liberal party. Norman Otto Hipel served as speaker for the assembly until September 2, 1938. James Howard Clark replaced Hipel as speaker. {| class="wikitable" !Riding !Member !Party |- |Addington |William David Black |Conservative |- |Algoma—Manitoulin |Wilfred Lynn Miller |Liberal |- |Beaches |Thomas Alexander Murphy |Conservative |- |Bellwoods |Arthur Wentworth Roebuck elected to federal seat in 1940 |Liberal |- |Bracondale |Lionel Pretoria Conacher |Liberal |- |Brant |Harry Corwin Nixon |Liberal |- |Brantford |Morrison Mann MacBridedied in 1938 |Independent-Liberal |- | |Louis Hagey (1938) |Liberal |- |Bruce |John William Sinclair |Liberal |- |Carleton |Adam Holland Acres |Conservative |- |Cochrane North |Joseph-Anaclet Habel |Liberal |- |Cochrane South |Charles Vincent Gallagher |Liberal |- |Dovercourt |William Duckworth |Conservative |- |Dufferin—Simcoe |Alfred Wallace Downer |Conservative |- |Durham |Cecil George Mercer |Liberal |- |Eglinton |Harold James Kirby |Liberal |- |Elgin |Mitchell Frederick Hepburn |Liberal |- |Essex North |Adélard Charles Trottier |Liberal |- |Essex South |Charles George Fletcher |Liberal |- |Fort William |Franklin Harford Spence |Conservative |- |Glengarry |Edmund MacGillivray |Liberal |- |Grenville—Dundas |George Holmes Challies |Conservative |- |Grey North |Roland Patterson |Liberal-Progressive |- |Grey South |Farquhar Robert Oliver |United Farmers |- |Haldimand—Norfolk |Eric William Blake Cross |Liberal |- |Halton |Thomas Aston Blakelock |Liberal |- |Hamilton Centre |William Frederick Schwenger named judge |Liberal |- | |John Newlands (1938) |Liberal |- |Hamilton East |John P.
