Conus poormani

Conus poormani, common name the Poorman's cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies. Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of "stinging" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all. ==Description== The size of the shell varies between 30 mm and 58 mm. ==Distribution== This marine species occurs off the Gulf of California, Western Mexico to Northern Peru ==References== * Tucker J.K. & Tenorio M.J.
