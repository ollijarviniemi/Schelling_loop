Artyom

Artyom () is a male given name common in Russia and other Slavic-speaking countries. The name uses the "ё" letter, which can be transcribed to English as "e" but still has the "yo" sound. Furthering the confusion, there is another name Artem (), whose only spelling in English is "Artem", and is pronounced with the "em" ending syllable. The Belarusian spelling is Арцём. A common diminutive form of the name is Tyoma (Тёма). The name is derived from the Ancient Greek name Artemios (Greek: Αρτέμιος), the name of the saint Artemius, derived from the name of the goddess Artemis. ==Notable people== *Artyom, nickname of Fyodor Sergeyev (1883–1921), Soviet revolutionary of Donets basin *Artyom Abramov, Russian footballer *Artyom Alikhanian, Soviet Armenian physicist *Artyom Alimov, Russian footballer *Artyom Anisimov, Russian footballer *Artyom Antipov, Russian footballer *Artyom Arefyev, Russian athlete *Artyom Argokov, Kazakhstani ice hockey player *Artyom Beketov, Russian footballer *Artyom Bezrodny, Russian footballer *Artyom Bludnov, Russian footballer *Artyom Bogucharsky, Russian actor *Artyom Borovik, Russian journalist *Artyom Danilenko, Russian footballer *Artyom Delkin, Russian footballer *Artyom Drobyshev, Russian footballer *Artyom Dudolev, Russian footballer *Artyom Dzyuba, Russian footballer *Artyom Fidler, Russian footballer *Artyom Filiposyan, Uzbek footballer *Artyom Fomin, Russian footballer *Artyom Fyodorov, Russian footballer *Artyom Ivanov (disambiguation), various people *Artyom Kabanov, Russian footballer *Artyom Kazakov, Russian footballer *Artyom Kuchin, Kazakhstani referee *Artyom Kulesha, Russian footballer *Artyom Leonov, Russian footballer *Artyom Lopatkin, Russian footballer *Artyom Madilov, Russian footballer *Artyom Mikheyev, Russian footballer *Artyom Mitasov, Russian footballer *Artyom Molodtsov, Russian footballer *Artyom Moskvin, Russian footballer *Artyom Motov, Russian footballer *Artyom Pasko, Russian footballer *Artyom Pershin, Russian footballer *Artyom Petrenko, Russian footballer *Artyom Popov, Russian footballer *Artyom Prokhorov, Russian footballer *Artyom Pugolovkin (born 1992), Russian ice hockey player *Artyom Rebrov, Russian footballer *Artyom Samsonov, Russian footballer, born 1989 *Artyom Samsonov, Russian footballer, born 1994 *Artyom Sapozhkov, Russian footballer *Artyom Senkevich, Belarusian ice hockey player *Artyom Serdyuk, Russian footballer *Artyom Shchadin, Russian footballer *Artyom Stepanov, Russian footballer *Artyom Timofeev Russian chess player *Artyom Timofeyev Russian footballer *Artyom Varakin, Russian footballer *Artyom Voronkin, Russian footballer *Artyom Zagrebin, Russian footballer Artyom, boris cat (from the YouTube channel Life of Boris), born in Moscow ==Artemy and Artemi spellings== *Artemy Lebedev, Russian web designer *Artemi Panarin, Russian hockey player ==See also== *Artyom, the main character in the book and game Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light, Metro Exodus and the novel Metro 2035.
