Młoda Ekstraklasa

Młoda Ekstraklasa (Young Ekstraklasa) (, official abbreviation MESA [ or (rarely) ]) was a Polish youth football league composed of the top youth teams of the 16 Ekstraklasa sides. It was contested by players 21 years of age and under, however, each side was allowed three players over the age limit (for the 2007–08 season: players born January 1, 1986 and after). In general, the matches took place a day after the two clubs' first teams have faced off, however the venues were switched. The team with the most points at the end of the season received the title of Młoda Ekstraklasa Champion. The games were organized with the aim of encouraging enhanced scouting and youth development in Poland and to provide regular competitive games for young players who often struggled to get playing time in the first team. In the first ever game, played on July 28, 2007 at the Stadion Śląski in Chorzów, Ruch Chorzów fell to visiting Dyskobolia Grodzisk (1–2). Ruch's Łukasz Janoszka scored the first ever goal. On May 18, 2008 Wisła Kraków clinched the first title, with a 1–0 win at home against runners-up Korona Kielce. Marcin Wodecki of Górnik Zabrze was the top goalscorer with 17 goals, closely followed by Artur Sobiech of Ruch Chorzów with 16. On March 20, 2013, at the meeting of the management board of Ekstraklasa SA, a decision was made to stop playing the games of the Młoda Ekstraklasa (2012–13 season was to be the last one) and to create the Central Junior League. ==Season-by-season== {| class="wikitable sortable" |- bgcolor="#CCCCCC" |align="center"| Edition |align="center"| Season |align="center"| Number of teams |align="center"| Winner |align="center"| Runner-up |align="center"| Third place |align="center"| Top scorer |- align="center" |align=center| I |align=center| 2007/2008 |align=center| 15 |align=center| Wisła Kraków |align=center| Korona Kielce |align=center| Cracovia | 17 goals – Marcin Wodecki (Górnik Zabrze) |- align="center" |align=center| II |align=center| 2008/2009 |align=center| 16 |align=center| Ruch Chorzów |align=center| Wisła Kraków |align=center| Polonia Warsaw | 21 goals – Kamil Biliński (Śląsk Wrocław) |- align="center" |align=center| III |align=center| 2009/2010 |align=center| 16 |align=center| Zagłębie Lubin |align=center| Legia Warsaw |align=center| Lech Poznań | 13 goals – Jakub Kaszuba (Cracovia) |- align="center" |align=center| IV |align=center| 2010/2011 |align=center| 16 |align=center| Zagłębie Lubin |align=center| Legia Warsaw |align=center| Ruch Chorzów | 15 goals – Łukasz Teodorczyk (Polonia Warsaw) |- align="center" |align=center| V |align=center| 2011/2012 |align=center| 16 |align=center| Legia Warsaw |align=center| Zagłębie Lubin |align=center| Śląsk Wrocław | 14 goals – Michał Grunt (Polonia Warsaw) |- align="center" |align=center| VI |align=center| 2012/2013 |align=center| 16 |align=center| Legia Warsaw |align=center| Lech Poznań |align=center| Śląsk Wrocław | 13 goals - Kamil Zieliński (Pogoń Szczecin) |} ==External links== * Mloda Ekstraklasa stats at 90minut.pl Category:Football leagues in Poland Pol Category:Ekstraklasa
