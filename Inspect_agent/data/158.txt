Homla

Homla is a river in the municipality of Malvik in Trøndelag county, Norway. The long river begins when it flows out of the lake Foldsjøen and it ends when it empties into the Trondheimsfjord at the village of Hommelvik. The Homla was first used by the timber industry to transport recently cut trees, but it is now just a small river with good fishing opportunities. Small-sized salmon and sea trout can be caught here. Around the year 2000, there were plans for constructing a large dam over the river's largest waterfall, "Storfossen". Due to local opposition, these plans were eventually aborted. ==See also== *List of rivers in Norway ==References== Category:Malvik Category:Rivers of Trøndelag Category:Rivers of Norway
