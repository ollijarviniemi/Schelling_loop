Arctonoe

Arctonoe is a genus belonging to the family Polynoidae, worms commonly known as "scale worms". Members of this genus predominantly occur in shallow (50 metres or less) waters of the North-east Pacific Ocean and often live as commensals of other marine invertebrates, frequently echinoderms but sometimes molluscs or other polychaetes. ==Description== Body long, with 100 or more segments and numerous pairs of smooth translucent elytra on segments 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 26, 28, 29, 31, 33 then alternating segments to the end of the body. The prostomium is rounded anteriorly (lacking peaks) and the lateral antennae are inserted terminoventrally. Parapodia with both dorsal (notopodial) and ventral (neuropodial) acicula penetrating epidermis. The notochaetae are few in number and more slender than the neuroochaetae both notochaetae and neuroochaetae have minutely notched tips (see Hanley, 1989 for detailed diagnosis). ==Species== The following species of Arctonoe are recognised as valid as of June 2020: *Arctonoe fragilis (Baird, 1863) *Arctonoe pulchra (Johnson, 1897) *Arctonoe vittata (Grube, 1855) ==References== Category:Polychaete genera Category:Phyllodocida
