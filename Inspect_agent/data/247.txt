Demetrios Ypsilantis

Demetrios Ypsilantis (also spelt using Dimitrios, Demetrius and/or Ypsilanti; ; ; 1793August 16, 1832) was a member of the prominent Phanariot Greek family Ypsilantis, dragomans of the Ottoman Empire. He served as an officer in the Imperial Russian Army and played an important role in the Greek War of Independence. Ypsilantis was the brother of Alexander Ypsilantis, leader of Filiki Eteria. ==Early life== A member of an important Phanariote family, he was the second son of Prince Constantine Ypsilantis of Moldavia. He was sent to France where he was educated at a French military school. ==Union of Moldavia and Wallachia== He distinguished himself as a Russian officer in the campaign of 1814. In 1821 he took part in the Wallachian uprising under the leadership of his brother Alexandros, that indirectly benefited the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia.East, The Union of Moldavia and Wallachia, 1859, p. 8. ==The Greek War of Independence== Sacred Band.

After the failure of the uprising in Wallachia, he went to the Morea (Peloponessus), where the Greek War of Independence had just broken out, as representative of Filiki Eteria and his brother. He was one of the most conspicuous of the Phanariote leaders during the early stages of the revolt, though he was much hampered by the local chiefs and by the civilian element headed by Alexandros Mavrokordatos; as a result the organisation of a regular army was slowed and operations were limited.John S. Koliopoulos, Brigands with a Cause - Brigandage and Irredentism in Modern Greece 1821-1912, Clarendon Press Oxford (1987), p. 68. He took part in the sieges of Tripolitsa, Nafplion and the Battle of Dervenakia, securing the Greek dominion in Morea. On 15 January 1822, he was elected president of the legislative assembly. However, due to the failure of his campaign in central Greece, and his failure to obtain a commanding position in the national convention of Astros, he was compelled to retire in 1823. After the landing of Ibrahim at Morea, he took part in the defence of Naplion in the Battle of the Lerna Mills. In 1828, he was appointed in the new established regular army by Ioannis Kapodistrias as commander of the troops in eastern Greece. On 25 September 1829, he successfully compelled Aslan Bey to capitulate at the Pass of Petra (Battle of Petra), thus ending the active operations of the war. ==Romance== He was known for an affair with Manto Mavrogenous, who was a Greek heroine of the Greek War of Independence. ==Death== Demetrius Ypsilantis by Adam Friedel The funerary monument of Dimitrios Υpsilantis in Nafplion.
