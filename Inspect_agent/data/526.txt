Paul Starke

Paul Simon Starke (born 18 November 1990) is an English speedway rider. ==Career== Born in Hereford, Starke started his career with the Buxton Hitmen, before going on to have spells at a variety of different clubs during his development into an Elite League rider. Starke's most successful period to date was his 2 years with the Cradley Heathens in the National League. It was here that he won 2 league titles, forming a formidable partnership with Steve Worrall during the second year. His first spell in the Elite League was a disappointing one. After being selected by the Birmingham Brummies in the reserve rider draft the club closed midway through the season due to financial problems. Despite this disappointment Starke said he 'enjoyed his time at Birmingham' and described their downfall as a "crying shame." The following season Starke was back in the Elite League, this time being selected in the draft by reigning champions the Poole Pirates. ==References== Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:English motorcycle racers Category:Buxton Hitmen riders Category:Plymouth Devils riders Category:Rye House Rockets riders Category:Isle of Wight Islanders riders Category:Berwick Bandits riders Category:Cradley Heathens riders Category:Birmingham Brummies riders Category:Somerset Rebels riders Category:Poole Pirates riders
