Bloomberg Beta

Bloomberg Beta is an early stage venture capital firm with $225M under management, capitalized solely by Bloomberg. The fund exists to expand Bloombergâ€™s horizons by investing in companies that are creating profound change in the way business operates, with a focus on machine intelligence and the future of work. Bloomberg Beta was recognized by VC review site CB Insights as the #2 investor in AI. Led by technology business operator and entrepreneur Roy Bahat, Bloomberg Beta has an unconventional investing model where anyone on the team can independently say yes to a deal. The fund's operating manual is publicly available online. Bloomberg Beta launched in June 2013 with $75 million of funding from Bloomberg L.P. A second fund of $75 million was announced in July 2016. In October 2019, they announced a third fund of $75 million. Bloomberg Beta is headquartered in San Francisco, California, with additional operations in New York City. Areas where Bloomberg Beta invests include: content discovery, cybersecurity, data sets and services, developer tools, full-stack startups using technology to compete in a new way, hardware, human-computer interaction, learning, media distribution, new organizational models, open-source software, productivity tools, professional networks, technology platforms, workflow tools, and workplace communication. Bloomberg Beta uses data to find new customers. Their "Future Founders" project started in 2014 to predict who will start companies before they do. In 2014, Bloomberg Beta began publishing an annual Machine Intelligence landscape to better understand what was happening in the startup ecosystem with artificial intelligence and machine learning. In May 2017, Bahat co-founded and co-chaired The Shift Commission on Work, Workers, and Technology to study the effects of AI on work 10-20 years out, alongside the president of think-tank New America, Anne-Marie Slaughter.
