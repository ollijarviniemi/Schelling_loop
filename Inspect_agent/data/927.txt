The Winner stated that: > The picture is a distinctly good example of what can be accomplished in > locally-made films. The story is interesting... and has the right grip for > picture purposes. Some fine natural scenery has been secured for many of the > sections, and the Sydney-Emden fight has been cleverly worked out. On the > whole, Mr Monte Luke, the director, and all associated with him in the > production, have every reason to be proud of their work. However the film was not a success at the box office. ==For the Honour of Australia== The movie was combined with another film, How We Beat the Emden (1915), and the documentary How We Fought the Emden, to make a new movie for release in Britain called For the Honour of Australia (1916). A copy of this survives today.Paul Byrnes, For the Honour of Australia at Australian Screen Online ==References== ==External links== * *For Australia at National Film and Sound Archive *Clip from film at Australian Screen Online Category:Australian films Category:Australian black-and-white films Category:1915 films Category:1910s war drama films Category:Australian war drama films Category:Australian silent feature films Category:1915 drama films
