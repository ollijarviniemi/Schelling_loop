Teichmüller–Tukey lemma

In mathematics, the Teichmüller–Tukey lemma (sometimes named just Tukey's lemma), named after John Tukey and Oswald Teichmüller, is a lemma that states that every nonempty collection of finite character has a maximal element with respect to inclusion. Over Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the Teichmüller–Tukey lemma is equivalent to the axiom of choice, and therefore to the well-ordering theorem, Zorn's lemma, and the Hausdorff maximal principle. ==Definitions== A family of sets \mathcal{F} is of finite character provided it has the following properties: #For each A\in \mathcal{F}, every finite subset of A belongs to \mathcal{F}. #If every finite subset of a given set A belongs to \mathcal{F}, then A belongs to \mathcal{F}. ==Statement of the lemma== Let Z be a set and let \mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(Z). If \mathcal{F} is of finite character and X\in\mathcal{F}, then there is a maximal Y\in\mathcal{F} (according to the inclusion relation) such that X\subseteq Y. ==Applications== In linear algebra, the lemma may be used to show the existence of a basis. Let V be a vector space. Consider the collection \mathcal{F} of linearly independent sets of vectors. This is a collection of finite character. Thus, a maximal set exists, which must then span V and be a basis for V. == Notes == == References == * Brillinger, David R.
