Serpentine (book)

Serpentine, a forthcoming fantasy novella by Philip Pullman (to be published on 15 October 2020 in the United Kingdom), is set after His Dark Materials and before the second book of the The Book of Dust series. ==Origins== Serpentine was not originally intended for publication but was instead written in 2004 at the request of Nicholas Hytner (at that time artistic director of the National Theatre) to be auctioned for charity during the NT production of His Dark Materials; the work sold for a "substantial sum". At the time of writing Pullman had not intended to revisit Lyra as an adult but after the publication of The Secret Commonwealth decided to issue the novella as it prefigures Lyra and Pantalaimon's character development in The Book of Dust. ==Synopsis== In this story, a teenage Lyra and her d√¶mon Pantalaimon revisit Trollesund, the Arctic town prominently featured in Northern Lights as the place of her first meeting with the aeronaut Lee Scoresby and the armored bear Iorek Byrnison. They seek the witch-consul Dr. Lanselius in the hope of finding answers to their ability to separate. ==Audiobook== An audiobook narrated by Olivia Colman will be released on the same day as the print and ebook versions. ==References== Category:2020 short stories Category:Short stories by Philip Pullman Category:His Dark Materials books Category:Fantasy short stories Category:2020 children's books
