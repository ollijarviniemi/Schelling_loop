Gymnastics at the Pan American Games â€“ Women's team all-around

Women's events at the Gymnastics at the Pan American Games were first held at the 1959 Pan American Games. Three medals are awarded: gold for first place, silver for second place, and bronze for third place. Tie breakers have not been used in every year. In the event of a tie between two gymnasts, both names are listed, and the following position (second for a tie for first, third for a tie for second) is left empty because a medal was not awarded for that position. If three gymnastics tied for a position, the following two positions are left empty. ==Medalists== {| class="wikitable" |- ! Year !
