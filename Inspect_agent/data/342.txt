Poor Richard Club

1319 Locust Street The Poor Richard Club was a private club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, whose members were mostly members of the advertising industry. The club was founded in 1906 with 75 members, just a year after a similar club opened in New York. The advertising industry was on a quest for more respectability, and the clubs were created as a way to promote and enforce ethical guidelines. Nevertheless, they functioned largely as places to nurture business, social, and political relationships. The following year, the club purchased a large Victorian house at 239-241 Camac Street in which to hold their weekly lunches and monthly dinners. By 1911, membership had grown to 350. In 1916, the club published "Poor Richard's Dictionary of Philadelphia," an informative, sometimes humorous, guide to all aspects of the city, including historical landmarks, businesses, churches, hotels, hospitals, and clubs. The book was presented to Associated Advertising Clubs of the World members who attended the annual meeting held at the Poor Richard Club House.Officers of the Poor Richard Club In 1925, the club moved to the Dr. Joseph Leidy House, 1319 Locust Street, which they shared with the Charles Morris Price School of Advertising and Journalism, founded by members of the club in 1920. The club was instrumental in proposing, funding, and raising the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial, built in 1933. The club's major event was its annual banquet, at which the members presented an annual award for public service.
