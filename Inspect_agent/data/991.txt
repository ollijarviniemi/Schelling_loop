Instead, Euro-pop producers Team 33 has crafted a galloping bassline that make you want to twirl and sing along with the song's giddy chorus. Fun, fun, fun stuff". Music & Media commented that "the production team behind the success of such artists as Fun Factory have already enjoyed success with this track in their native Germany—where the song is a bonafide smash—in Italy and in the Netherlands. Their fine production job makes the most of a strong hook and nagging chorus, reminiscent of Crystal Waters' Gypsy Woman."" ==Music video== The music video for "Oh La La La" was directed by Camelot. ==Track listings== ; CD maxi - Europe (1997) # "Oh La La La" (Radio Mix) - 3:35 # "Oh La La La" (Cool Summer Mix) - 3:38 # "Oh La La La" (Extended Version) - 4:58 # "Oh La La La" (Salinas Mix) - 5:11 # "Oh La La La" (Eivissa '97 Club Mix) - 6:19 # "Oh La La La" (S/M In Motion Remix) - 6:32 ==Charts== {|class="wikitable sortable" !Chart (1997) !Peak position |- |Belgium Dance (Ultratop) |align="center"|20 |- |Canada Dance (RPM) |align="center"|3 |- |Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |align="center"|32 |- |- |Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40) |align="center"|24 |- |Ireland (IRMA)Search for Irish peaks |align="center"|19 |- |Italy (FIMI)Top Italian singles of 1997 |align="center"|1 |- |Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) |align="center"|24 |- |Netherlands (Single Top 100) |align="center"|30 |- |Scotland (Official Charts Company) |align="center"|19 |- |Spain (AFYVE)Billboard: Hits of the World, 19 July 1997 |align="center"|1 |- |UK Singles (Official Charts Company)UK peak OfficialCharts.com/ Archived copy at WebCite (3 June 2009). |align="center"|13 |- |UK Dance (Official Charts Company) |align="center"|8 |- |US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play |align="center"|10 |- |} ==References== Category:1997 debut singles Category:1997 songs Category:Eurodance songs Category:Number-one singles in Italy Category:Number-one singles in Spain
