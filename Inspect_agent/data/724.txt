Mirror (Lil Wayne song)

"Mirror" is a song by American rapper Lil Wayne featuring American singer- songwriter Bruno Mars. The second bonus track on the deluxe edition of Tha Carter IV (2011), was released to Urban contemporary radio stations as the sixth and final single on September 13, 2011, through Young Money, Cash Money, and Universal Republic Records. Wayne, Mars, Phillip Lawrence and Ramon Owen wrote "Mirror". Owen also handled production as REO of the Soundkillers, and The Smeezingtons. The song leaked online a few days before the album's official release in the United States. The track was produced three years before its release. Owen, with Mike Caren's help, was able to get the track to several rappers, who rejected it. Lil Wayne liked the song after hearing it, however, and his verses were added to Mars' hook vocals already on the track. Music critics gave "Mirror" positive reviews praising it for Mars' smooth, epic hook and Wayne's introspective verses. The hip-hop and rap ballad has been compared in its composition to "Lighters" (2011) by Bad Meets Evil featuring Bruno Mars and lyrically to Wayne's single "How to Love" (2011) from the same album. Its lyrics describe the downfalls of life, as well as Wayne's upbringing, state of mind, past choices and personal life. "Mirror" debuted at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 17 in the United Kingdom. It also peaked in the top 15 of Denmark, Netherlands, and appeared on charts in Switzerland, and Belgium (Flanders). It has been certified three times platinum in the United States. In Denmark, it received two different certifications, gold for units shipped, and two times platinum for its streaming numbers. Antoine Fuqua directed the accompanying music video, filmed in November 2011, with visual effects created by GloriaFX. It depicts Wayne throwing red, black and white paint on the walls of a room creating an undefined painting, while Mars sings on top of a ladder. The video ends with a scene showing a painting of Wayne, toned in red, crucified on the cross holding a mic in his left hand. Critics complimented its aesthetics. Wayne performed the song during his tour in Australia. ==Release and production== "Mirror" was released as the album's sixth and final single. Young Money, Cash Money and Universal Republic Records released the track to American urban contemporary radio stations, which began adding the track to their playlists on September 13, 2011. On November 1, 2011, the single was re-released in the same format and to rhythmic contemporary stations by Cash Money and Universal Republic Records.

The producer, Reo" Owen of the Soundkillers, with help of Mike Caren, Atlantic Records A&R;, was able to get this recording, which already had Bruno Mars singing the hook, heard by industry "heavy-hitters" including rappers Kanye West, Drake, and Nas. They rejected it. Lil Wayne liked the track and decided to keep it. "REO" initially wanted the track to be a part of West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010). He to "settle[ed]" for it being included on Wayne's Tha Carter IV. He felt lucky it was given the amount of material recorded during the time an album is produced. Owen claimed he alone produced the track with The Smeezingtons as co-writers, however, the CD's liner notes also credit the team as co-producers. "REO" agreed that Wayne's verses captured the feeling of the song. The track leaked on August 25, 2011. In late 2014, Ramon "REO" Owen filed a lawsuit against Wayne alleging he had promised him at least $91,000 for his work on the song. According to the lawsuit, Owen never received this payment. On February 19, 2015, Manhattan Federal Court judge, Katherine B. Forrest, order Wayne to pay Owen $100,000 and Young Money to "hand over" their accounting records, as they failed to respond to the allegations in court, after being served with the legal documents in December 2014. During the judgment, Owen stated that he tried to contact Wayne regarding the money for 11 months prior to the lawsuit. According to court filings, Owen is entitled to $91,841.50 in royalties. ==Composition== "Mirror" is a hip-hop and rap ballad composed in the key of F Minor, set at a tempo of 80 beats per minute. The melody spans the tonal range of C4 to D♭5, while the music follows the chord progression of Fm-E-Cm–E♭–Db. Its instrumental has been described as "an eerie wail in the background and a smothered kick-and snare-drum pattern". This is noticeable due to its tripped-down production and melancholy harmonies, echoing and somber beats. Rap-Up noted the resemblance between the structure of "Mirror" and "Lighters" (2011) by Bad Meets Evil, which also features Bruno Mars. In the track, Mars shows his emo-angst by singing: "Through my rise and fall/ You've been my only friend" and Wayne gets "reflective" on his verses "Looking at me now I can see my past/Damn, I look just like my f—king dad/Light it up, that's smoke in mirrors/I even look good in the broken mirror." Wayne not only shows his "warped, troubled mind" but also his softer side by rapping about his father. Overall, Wayne reflects on his past choices and his life. Various publications affirmed that Lil Wayne took inspiration from Michael Jackson in one of his verses: "And no message any clearer, so I'm starting with the "Man in the Mirror" (1987). Idolator Becky Bain found similarities between Wayne's single "How to Love" (2011) from the same album for its "introspective, sad and sweet" lyrics. ==Critical reception== The song received positive reviews from most music critics. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song four stars out of five. He found that "The final result is much like the heartthrob himself; love-torn, moody and destined to be popular." Billboards Joe DeAndrea commented that the track was not only among Lil Wayne's best material, and found the vocals on the hook provided by Mars are quite "smooth". Another Billboard critic, Maria Sherman, praised Mars' hook, calling it "cinematic". Omar Burgess of HipHopDX praised Wayne for "pushing the envelope" describing "Mirror" as a concept track. Conversely, brookencool of Complex included the track on his list of The 10 Worst Lil Wayne Songs. He felt Wayne's and Mars' vocals sounded "forced and pieced together", and deemed the collaboration ineffective. Moreover, the critic found the song's reflective lyrics about Wayne's past and his mistakes shallow compared to Wayne's "All By Myself". ==Commercial performance== In the United States, "Mirror" debuted at its peak of number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100, and at number six on the Hot Digital Songs chart, with 149,000 copies sold in its first week.
