On the final cruise, a "final checker" was sucked into an engine inlet, and was caught on the carrier close circuit TV. Subsequently, this video was shown on multiple TV video shows. The crew member survived, as his shoulder jammed into the "bullet" of the engine, and due to the quick thinking and training of the aircrew and deck crew, they were able to shut down before he was sucked down through the blades. His cranial and radio equipment were sucked in, and destroyed the engine. Later that night bandaged and bruised he appeared on the closed circuit TV station with the Roosevelt's CO, and discussed his ordeal. *26 March 1993: The squadron held a disestablishment ceremony at NAS Oceana, it was officially disestablished on 31 March 1993. ===Insignia and "The Beast" nickname=== The squadron's first insignia was approved by CNO on 9 August 1945. During the time when the squadron's insignia was approved, VT-74 was flying the SB2C which was nicknamed "The Beast". Consequently, the squadron's insignia took on the shape of a beast riding a torpedo. There is no record of the colors used for this insignia. After VT-74 was redesignated VA-2B, it continued to use the old insignia until 17 April 1947 when CNO approved a new insignia for the squadron. The insignia adopted by VA-2B reflected the squadron's new attack mission. The horsehead chess piece was designed to relate the squadron's power to that of a medieval knight and the fleur-de-lis represented integrity. Colors for the insignia were: a yellow background; red scroll with yellow lettering, black banner with a black and white pole; white knight with a yellow collar; a white lightning bolt; and the Fleur-de-lis was red with a black band. The Knight insignia continued as the official insignia for the squadron following its redesignation to VA-25 on 1 September 1948. A new insignia for VA-25 was approved by CNO on 4 April 1950. The new insignia was a front view of a tiger on the prowl. Colors were: yellow background; brown tiger with green eyes, and white teeth, whiskers and claws; and a red tongue and mouth. When VA-25 was redesignated VA-65 in 1959 the tiger insignia was retained and remained VA-65's insignia until its disestablishment. Nickname: Tigers 1950–1993. ==Home port assignments== *Naval Auxiliary Air Field Otis, Camp Edwards, Massachusetts 1 May 1945 *Naval Air Station Norfolk October 1945 *Naval Auxiliary Air Field Charlestown February 1946 *Naval Air Station Oceana June 1946 *Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City 20 November 1950 *Naval Auxiliary Air Station/Naval Air Station Oceana* 20 September 1951 NAAS Oceana was redesignated NAS Oceana on 1 April 1952. ==Aircraft Assignment== *Curtiss SB2C-4E Helldiver May 1945 *Curtiss SB2C-4E Helldiver July 1945 *Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldiver February 1946 *Grumman TBM-3E Avenger February 1946 *Grumman SBW-5 Avenger 1946 *North American SNJ-4 July 1947 *Douglas AD-1 Skyraider July 1947 *Douglas AD-4 Skyraider 1 December 1949 *Douglas AD-6/A-1H Skyraider October 1953 *Grumman A-6A Intruder March 1965 *Grumman A-6B Intruder December 1968 *Grumman KA-6D Intruder 1971 *Grumman A-6E Intruder 3 May 1972 ==Major overseas deployments== {| class="wikitable" |- !Departure !Return !Air Wing !Carrier !Aircraft !Area of Operation |- |29 October 1947 |11 March 1948 |CVBG-1 |CVB 41 |AD-1 |Med |- |3 May 1949 |25 September 1949 |CVG-2 |CVB 43 |AD-1 |Med |- |10 January 1951 |18 May 1951 |CVG-6 |CVB 42 |AD-4 |Med |- |9 January 1952 |5 May 1952 |CVG-6 |CVB 41 |AD-4 |Med |- |26 August 1952 |8 October 1952 |CVG-6 |CVB 41 |AD-4 |NorLant |- |1 December 1952 |19 May 1953 |CVG-6 |CVA 41 |AD-4 |Med |- |4 January 1954 |4 August 1954 |CVG-6 |CVA 41 |AD-6 |Med |- |9 October 1955 |30 April 1956 |CVG-6 |CVA 39 |AD-6 |Med |- |3 September 1957 |21 October 1957 |CVG-6 |CVA 11 |AD-6 |NorLant |- |12 February 1959 |30 August 1959 |CVG-6 |CVA 11 |AD-6 |Med |- |4 August 1960 |17 February 1961 |CVG-6 |CVA 11 |AD-6 |Med |- |3 August 1961 |1 March 1962 |CVG-6 |CVA 11 |AD-6 |Med |- |3 August 1962 |11 October 1962 |CVG-6 |CVAN 65 |A-1H |Med |- |19 October 1962 |6 December 1962 |CVG-6 |CVAN 65 |A-1H |Carib |- |6 February 1963 |4 September 1963 |CVG-6 |CVAN 65 |A-1H |Med |- |8 February 1964 |3 October 1964 |CVW-6 |CVAN 65 |A-1H |Med/World Cruise |- |12 May 1966 |3 December 1966 |CVW-15 |CVA 64 |A-6A |WestPac/Vietnam |- |6 June 1967 |15 September 1967 |CVW-17 |CVA 59 |A-6A |WestPac/Vietnam |- |30 December 1968 |4 September 1969 |CVW-11 |CVA 63 |A-6A/B |WestPac/Vietnam |- |23 June 1970 |31 January 1971 |CVW-7 |CVA 62 |A-6A |Med |- |16 September 1971 |16 March 1972 |CVW-7 |CVA 62 |A-6A/KA-6D |NorLant/Med |- |21 June 1973 |19 January 1974 |CVW-7 |CV 62 |A-6E/KA-6D |Med |- |19 July 1974 |21 January 1975 |CVW-7 |CV 62 |A-6E/KA-6D |Med |- |15 October 1975 |5 May 1976 |CVW-7 |CV 62 |A-6E/KA-6D |NorLant/Med |- |31 March 1977 |21 October 1977 |CVW-7 |CV 62 |A-6E/KA-6D |Med |- |16 January 1979 |13 July 1979 |CVW-7 |CVN 69 |A-6E/KA-6D |Med |- |15 April 1980 |22 December 1980 |CVW-7 |CVN 69 |A-6E/KA-6D |IO |- |20 August 1981 |7 October 1981 |CVW-7 |CVN 69 |A-6E/KA-6D |NorLant |- |5 January 1982 |13 July 1982 |CVW-7 |CVN 69 |A-6E/KA-6D |Med |- |27 April 1983 |2 December 1983 |CVW-7 |CVN 69 |A-6E/KA-6D |Med |- |8 May 1984 |20 June 1984 |CVW-7 |CVN 69 |A-6E/KA-6D |Carib/NorLant |- |10 October 1984 |8 May 1985 |CVW-7 |CVN 69 |A-6E/KA-6D |Med |- |8 July 1985 |22 August 1985 |CVW-7 |CVN 69 |A-6E/KA-6D |Carib |- |29 September 1987 |28 March 1988 |CVW-13 |CV 43 |A-6E |Med |- |31 May 1989 |30 September 1989 |CVW-13 |CV 43 |A-6E |Med |- |28 December 1990 |28 June 1991 |CVW-8 |CVN 71 |A-6E |Med/Red Sea/Persian Gulf |} ==Air Wing Assignments== {| class="wikitable" |- !Air Wing Tail Code !Assignment Date |- |CVG-74 |1 May 1945 |- |CVBG-1* M |15 November 1946 |- |CVG-2† M |1 September 1948 |- |CVG-6 C |August 1950 |- |CVG-6 AF‡CVG-6/CVW-6§ AE§ RCVW-4 AD |1 January 1965 |- |COMFAIRNORFOLK |5 June 1965 |- |CVW-15 NL |20 February 1966 |- |COMFAIRNORFOLK |3 December 1966 |- |CVW-17 AA |22 December 1966 |- |COMFAIRNORFOLK |15 September 1967 |- |CVW-11 NH |1968 |- |COMFAIRNORFOLK |September 1969 |- |CVW-7 AG |February 1970 |- |CVW-13 AK |1 September 1986 |- |CVW-8 AJ |30 October 1989 |} : * CVG-74 was redesignated CVBG-1 on 15 November 1946. : † CVBG-1 was redesignated CVG-2 on 1 September 1948. : ‡ CVG-6’s tail code was changed from C to AF in the latter part of 1957.
