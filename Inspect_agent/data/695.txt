Army Creek

Army Creek is a long river in northern Delaware in the United States that drains about . The stream is controlled by a floodgate just downstream of DE 9 that does not allow tidal influence of the stream. The source of Army Creek is near the eastern edge of Bear, Delaware in the south and New Castle County Airport in the north. The water then flows ENE to the Delaware River about SW of New Castle, Delaware, at Dobbinsville. Most of the watershed is urban/residential. The watershed is the scene of two Superfund sites owing to the urban/industrial history. ==See also== * List of Delaware rivers == References == == External links == *Delaware Watersheds *Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) Analysis for the Watersheds of Army Creek, Delaware Category:Rivers of Maryland Category:Tributaries of the Delaware River
