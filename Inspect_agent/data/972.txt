''''', known in English as Class Relations, in French as ''''', is a 1984 film by the French filmmaking duo of Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet. It is based on Franz Kafka's unfinished first novel, Amerika. The German filmmaker Harun Farocki appears as one of the leads, and the film also features a cameo from American experimental filmmaker Thom Andersen. A documentary was made about the filming process, '. ==Cast== *Christian Heinisch as Karl Roßmann *Nazzareno Bianconi as Giacomo *Mario Adorf as Onkel *Laura Betti as Brunelda *Harun Farocki as Delamarche *Manfred Blank as Robinson * as Heizer *Anna Schnell as Line *Klaus Traube as Kapitän *Georg Brintrup as Student *Hermann Hartmann as Oberkassierer *Gérard Semaan as Schubal *Jean-François Quinque as Stewart *Villi Vöbel as Pollunder ==Style== As Franz Kafka never visited the United States, the film was intentionally shot in Europe, with the bulk of shooting occurring in Germany. The film features prominently architecture, flora and costuming (including a policeman in a bobby helmet) that is unlikely to be found in the United States. Only a handful of shots were shot on location in the United States, including the Statue of Liberty and the Missouri River. Though Huillet and Straub are both French, the film was shot in German, the book's original language. The film was shot on black-and-white 35mm Kodak film stock by French cinematographer William Lubtchansky. Like all other Straub-Huillet films, it only uses location sound recorded at the same time as the image, emphasizing cinema's documentary nature over the pictorial. ==Awards== The film was entered into the 34th Berlin International Film Festival where it won an Honourable Mention. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1984 films Category:1980s avant-garde and experimental films Category:1980s historical drama films Category:1984 independent films Category:1980s business films Category:Films about cities Category:Films about education Category:Films about social class Category:Films based on works by Franz Kafka Category:Films based on Austrian novels Category:Films directed by Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet Category:Films set in department stores Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Films set on ships Category:Films shot in New York City Category:French avant-garde and experimental films Category:French black-and- white films Category:French films Category:French historical drama films Category:French independent films Category:German avant-garde and experimental films Category:German black-and-white films Category:German historical drama films Category:German independent films Category:1980s drama road movies Category:German drama road movies Category:West German films
