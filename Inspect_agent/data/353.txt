Cuno Hoffmeister

Cuno Hoffmeister (2 February 1892 – 2 January 1968) was a German astronomer, observer and discoverer of variable stars, comets and minor planets, and founder of Sonneberg Observatory. Born in Sonneberg in 1892 to Carl and Marie Hoffmeister, Cuno Hoffmeister obtained his first telescope in 1905 and became an avid amateur astronomer. After his father lost most of his money in 1914, Hoffmeister had to leave school in 1916 to start an apprenticeship in his father's company. During this time he continued to study spherical mathematics and trigonometry. In April 1915 he had the opportunity to substitute as the assistant of Ernst Hartwig at Remeis Observatory in Bamberg while the current holder of the position was drafted, mainly working on observations of meteors and variable stars. He held this position until the end of the war and then moved back to Sonneberg, where he made his Abitur in 1920. After studying at the University of Jena, while at the same time continuing to work in his job as a tradesman, Hoffmeister obtained his doctorate in 1927. During this time he had already started building what was to become Sonneberg Observatory. After his PhD, he moved back to Sonneberg and started expanding the observatory. Hoffmeister remained at the observatory until his death, even though the observatory lost most of its equipment after World War II and he was disowned as the observatory became part of East Germany's academy of sciences. Hoffmeister served as the director of the observatory until his death. During his life he played a leading role in supporting amateurs in observations of noctilucent clouds, aurorae, and nightglow. == Discoveries == {| class="wikitable" align="right" style="margin-left: 0.8em; margin-top: 0; font-size: 0.9em;" |+ Asteroids discovered: 5 |- | 2183 Neufang || 26 July 1959 |- | 3203 Huth || 18 September 1938 |- | 3674 Erbisbühl || 13 September 1963 |- | 4183 Cuno || 5 June 1959 |- | 4724 Brocken || 18 January 1961 |} During his active life as an astronomer, Hoffmeister discovered approximately 10,000 variable stars on the more than 100,000 photographic plates taken at Sonneberg Observatory. The Minor Planet Center credits him with the discovery of 5 asteroids between 1938 and 1963. He also co-discovered C/1959 O1, a hyperbolic comet, in 1957. == Honors == The lunar crater Hoffmeister and the two minor planets 1726 Hoffmeister and 4183 Cuno were named in his honor (). == References == == External links == * Cuno Hoffmeister, Mitteilungen der Astronomischen Gesellschaft 24, 5 * Cuno Hoffmeister, Irish Astronomical Journal 9, 169 Category:1892 births Category:1968 deaths Category:People from Sonneberg Category:People from Saxe-Meiningen Category:Nazi Party members Category:German astronomers Category:East German scientists Category:Discoverers of comets Category:Discoverers of asteroids * Category:University of Jena alumni Category:Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin Category:Members of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina Category:Recipients of the National Prize of East Germany
