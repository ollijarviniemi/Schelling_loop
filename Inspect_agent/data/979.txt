Caravan to Midnight

Caravan to Midnight is the sixth studio album by Robin Trower. The album cover art is by Hipgnosis. It was reissued in 1997 as a 2-on-1 CD along with his next 1980 album Victims of the Fury. == Critical reception == Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote: "Over the years somewhat disappointing sales have convinced Trower that maybe all the people who found themselves stultified by his Hendrix clonings were onto something. On this album, therefore, he's made a point of mixing the vocals way up, so that the Paul Rodgers clonings of lead vocalist/second banana James Dewar can actually be discerned by the casual listener. Yug." ==Track listing== All tracks by James Dewar and Robin Trower except where noted ===Side one=== #"My Love (Burning Love)" – 3:17 #"Caravan to Midnight" (Robin Trower) – 5:01 #"I'm Out to Get You" – 5:24 #"Lost in Love" – 4:27 ===Side two=== #"Fool" – 3:45 #"It's for You" – 4:38 #"Birthday Boy" – 3:51 #"King of the Dance" – 3:10 #"Sail On" – 4:02 == Personnel == * Jimmy Dewar – vocals * Robin Trower – guitar * Rustee Allen – bass * Bill Lordan – drums * Paulinho da Costa – percussion (tracks 1-3, 6, 8) ==Charts== {| class="wikitable" !Chart (1978) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align="center"|87 |- |United States (Billboard 200) |align="center"|37 |} ==References== == External links == * Robin Trower - Caravan to Midnight (1978) album releases & credits at Discogs * Robin Trower - Caravan to Midnight (1978) album to be listened on Spotify * Robin Trower - Caravan to Midnight (1978) album to be listened on YouTube Category:1978 albums Category:Robin Trower albums Category:Albums with cover art by Hipgnosis Category:Chrysalis Records albums
