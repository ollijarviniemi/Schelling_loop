Bank of Alberta

The Bank of Alberta was a bank based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada from 1984 to 1988. It was formed during a challenging economic environment that pushed many competitors to rein in their activities in key western markets. As a result, the bank ultimately had a significant impact on the evolution of modern banking in Western Canada. ==History== When the bank commenced operations in 1984 it was led by Canadian Business Hall of Fame member Dr. Charles Allard and Eugene Pechet, starting with three employees working out of a boardroom located in one of Pechet's hotels in Edmonton, Alberta.The Government of Alberta supported the newly formed Bank of Alberta by investing in 5% of its shares. In 1988, the Bank of Alberta merged with Western & Pacific Bank to form Canadian Western Bank (CWB). ==See also== * List of banks in Canada == References == Category:Banks established in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in Alberta Category:Defunct banks of Canada Category:Companies based in Edmonton Category:Banks disestablished in 1988 Category:1988 disestablishments in Alberta
