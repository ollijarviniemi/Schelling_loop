Lewes Speed Trials

The Lewes Speed Trials were speed trials held on a defunct course in Lewes, Sussex, England, sometimes known as "The Motor Road." ==History== The first meeting took place on 27 July 1924, on "a private road near Lewes", location unidentified. The event was organised by the Brighton & Hove Motor Cycle and Light Car Club, on a quarter-mile course. Fastest time of the day was set by J.A. Hall, Frazer Nash-GN, in a time of 16.6 secs.T.R. Nicholson, Sprint - Speed Hillclimbs and Speed Trials in Britain: 1899-1925, Page 236, David & Charles, 1969. > "Speed trials were held on the Race Hill at Lewes three or four times a year > from 1925 to 1939, at the instance of the Brighton & Hove MC, the Kent & > Sussex LCC, the Bugatti Owners' Club and the Vintage Sports Car Club,..." > T.R. Nicholson, Sprint - Speed Hillclimbs and Speed Trials in Britain: > 1899-1925, Page 241, David & Charles, 1969. In 1933 The Autocar reported: > "The course bends slightly to the left, is one-third of a mile long, narrow, > none too smooth, and slightly uphill. It leads directly off the London- > Newhaven road just before reaching Lewes." The Autocar, 27 October 1933, > Page 853. Jean Bugatti attended the races on 21 October 1933.The Autocar, 27 October 1933, Page 853. Denis Jenkinson, motor racing journalist, attended his first motor sport event here in 1936.D.S.J. letter to Motor Sport, November 1939, Page 308. The Autocar reported from the meeting on 12 June 1937: "The first appearance in competition of the new four-wheel independent-suspension Atalanta was at Lewes. G.A.T. Weldon drove this 1½-litre model." The Autocar, 18 June 1937, Pages 1196-1197, including picture. Bill Boddy, editor of Motor Sport, drove the original HRG sports car, 1,497 c.c., at Lewes on 4 September 1937 with a best time of 27.4 sec, finishing third in the novices class.Motor Sport, October 1937, Pages 433-434; Bugatti Owners' Club Lewes Speed Trials, Saturday 4 September 1937, Results. On 15 July 1939, Sydney Allard took a class win in a time of 22.12 secs.Motor Sport, August 1939, Page 232. ==The Lewes Record== Comparisons of times recorded at different meetings and by different clubs are problematic. There were differences in the method of timing (the electric Bachelier method favoured by the Bugatti O.C. allowed the competitor to start in his own time) and even differences in the length of the course.Autocar, 28 August 1936, Pages 396-397. ==Lewes Speed Trials past winners== {|class="wikitable" !width="*"|Year !width="*"|Driver !width="*"|Vehicle !width="*"|Time !width="*"|Club !width="*"|Notes |- | rowspan=4|1932 | R.G.J.
